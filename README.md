# MVC-Application-Design-using-.NET-Core-2.0
Welcome to the Designing an MVC Application course! In this course, you will learn and apply fundamental aspects of MVC design. The course covers:  Overview of MVC Defining Models Defining and Creating Views Linking Models and Views with Controllers Unlike some other courses you may have taken, this course has a focus on design concepts and while you will apply them using some coding, the labs are not a complete application.  The intention is to provide you with a good foundational knowledge of MVC design using ASP.NET Core which you will later apply in a follow up course, Program a Server-Side Application using ASP.NET Core. In that course, you will build an online bulletin board application using the MVC knowledge you gained in this course.
